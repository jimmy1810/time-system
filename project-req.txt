TIME CARDS SYSTEM

A startup company recently got a project from a multinational on Time And Money basis.
Which would mean he would have to ask each of his employees to enter on a daily basis the time they have spent on the project into a tool,
and extract at the end of the month for billing to the customer. Can you design a time card management system for him that includes holidays, overtime hours, leaves (sick and casual),
trainings etc
